# Mission Demolition
 
Most of this project was modeled after Jeremy Gibson Bond's Mission Demolition tutorial in chapter 30 of "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development." Despite this, I added changes such as:

-A "game over" screen with a "restart" button

-More levels that get increasingly harder

-Audio for the slingshot snapping

-A 20% chance of double velocity for the current projectile and its subsequent projectiles during that level, indicated by the first sped up projectile being red
