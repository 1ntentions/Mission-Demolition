# Mission Demolition
 
I made the following changes after following the tutorial from chapter 30 of "Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development" by Jeremy Gibson Bond. Despite this, I added changes such as:

-A "game over" screen with a "restart" button

-More levels that get increasingly harder as you progress

-A black band that appears when the projectile is drawn in the slingshot and disappears when it is shot

-Audio for the slingshot snapping

-A 20% chance of double velocity for the current projectile and its subsequent projectiles during that level, indicated by the first sped up projectile being red
